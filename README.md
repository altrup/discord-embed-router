An [Express](https://expressjs.com)-inspired, URL-path-based router for [discord.js](https://discord.js.org) interactions. Define routes once, render an embed for each, and get buttons/select menus/modals that "link" to them for free — no more hand-rolled `customId` parsing.

## Why

Handling Discord message components usually means switching on `customId` strings by hand, threading state through them yourself, and hoping two features never pick the same prefix. `discord-embed-router` treats your bot's UI like a tiny web app instead:

- **Routes** — register a path (`/catalog/:id`) and a handler that returns the embed/components to render, the same way you'd write an Express route and its response.
- **Component builders** — `RouteButtonBuilder`, `RouteStringSelectMenuBuilder`, `RouteModalBuilder`, etc. encode the destination path/query into the component's `customId` for you.
- **Sessions** — attach per-message state that persists across clicks without you managing a cache.
- **Cleanup/timeout** — declare what a stale component should turn into once its window expires.

## Install

```bash
npm install discord-embed-router discord.js
```

`discord.js` is a peer dependency — you bring your own compatible version (see `peerDependencies` in [`package.json`](package.json) for the supported range).

## Quick start

```ts
import { EmbedRouter, RouteButtonBuilder } from "discord-embed-router";
import {
	ActionRowBuilder,
	ButtonStyle,
	Client,
	EmbedBuilder,
} from "discord.js";

const client = new Client({ intents: [] });
const router = new EmbedRouter<undefined, number>(client);
router.onError(console.error);

router.get("/counter", (embedRouter, interaction, state) => {
	const value = state.session.get() ?? 0;
	state.session.set(value);

	return {
		embeds: [new EmbedBuilder().setTitle("Counter").setDescription(`${value}`)],
		components: [
			new ActionRowBuilder()
				.addComponents(
					new RouteButtonBuilder(embedRouter)
						.setLabel("+1")
						.setStyle(ButtonStyle.Success)
						.setTo("/counter/increment", { method: "POST" }),
				)
				.toJSON(),
		],
		// required whenever a route touches the session, so the router knows
		// when to drop the stored count
		timeout: 5 * 60 * 1000,
	};
});

router.post("/counter/increment", (_embedRouter, _interaction, state) => {
	state.session.set((state.session.get() ?? 0) + 1);
	return { redirect: "/counter" };
});

client.on("interactionCreate", async (interaction) => {
	if (
		interaction.isChatInputCommand() &&
		interaction.commandName === "counter"
	) {
		await router.dispatch(interaction, "/counter");
	}
});

client.login(process.env.DISCORD_TOKEN);
```

Clicking "+1" fires a `POST /counter/increment`, which mutates the count stored in the message's session and redirects to `GET /counter` to re-render. Storing the count in a session rather than baking it into the button's `customId` matters here: the router serializes dispatches per message, so a read-modify-write against the session can't race itself the way two rapid clicks would if each button's `customId` captured a stale value at render time (both clicks would send the same "value + 1" and one increment would be lost).

See [`examples/basic-bot`](examples/basic-bot) for a full bot with multiple routes, a catalog page, and command wiring.

## Core concepts

### Routes

`router.get/post/put/patch/delete(path, handler)` registers a handler for a path, using [`path-to-regexp`](https://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp) syntax for params (`/user/:id`). `router.modal(path, handler)` registers a handler that returns a modal to show instead of editing the message. A `GET` handler's return value is the new message content; other methods must return a `redirect` (to a registered `GET` path) or `undefined` (silent ack).

Routers can be nested with `router.use(prefix, subRouter)`, mirroring how you'd compose an Express app.

### Component builders

`RouteButtonBuilder`, `RouteStringSelectMenuBuilder`, `RouteChannelSelectMenuBuilder`, `RouteRoleSelectMenuBuilder`, `RouteUserSelectMenuBuilder`, and `RouteModalBuilder` extend their discord.js counterparts, replacing `setCustomId`/`setURL` with `.setTo(path, { method, query })`. The router encodes the path into a compact `customId` and decodes it back on click.

### Sessions

Pass a `Session` type parameter to `EmbedRouter<Globals, Session, Locals>` and use `state.session.get()/set()/delete()` inside a handler to keep state tied to a message across multiple interactions (e.g. a multi-step form). Any handler that sets a session or a `cleanup` must also return a `timeout`, so the router always knows when to give up on stale state.

### Cleanup and timeouts

A `GET` handler can return `{ cleanup, timeout }` alongside its content. If no further interaction lands on that message before `timeout` ms, `cleanup` runs and its return value (if any) is applied to the message — handy for expiring a form or disabling stale buttons.

### Encoding

By default, paths are compacted with `HashEncoder` so `customId`s stay under Discord's 100-character limit even for deeply nested routes. Pass a custom `Encoder` via the `EmbedRouter` constructor if you need different encoding behavior.
